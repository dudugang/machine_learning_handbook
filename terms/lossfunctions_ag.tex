The driving force of any mathematical optimization problem, especially in machine learning, is the loss function, measuring how well an algorithm is performing with regards to its target. In general terms, the evaluation for any learning problem is done by taking a predicted or estimated output and compare it to the relative real recorded outcome, typically in a dataset. The expected value of the loss is called the statistical risk. The formulation of the loss function is crucial and must be accurately defined according to the selected algorithm and the selected data for the particular optimization problem. The loss function must reproduce a numerical value that somehow reflects the level of achievement desired by the algorithm.  In machine learning we are typically attempting to find the parameters that fit our model and that minimizes the loss function. Minimizing the loss function is one of the fundamental foundations of statistical machine learning \citep{pmlr-v32-yanga14}.

The three canonical loss functions as described by Vapnik \citep{vapnik1998statistical} are:
\begin{itemize} \item The 0-1 Loss – the simplest loss function mainly used in binary classification \begin{equation} L(y,\hat{y}) \end{equation}, resulting in an error of 0 if and only if $y == \hat{y}$. Otherwise the function will produce the value of 1. This does not however differentiate between different classes and types of errors. Variations of this function may thus be formulated by extending the simple loss function and make the resulting loss dependent on another function.
\item The squared loss – the equation used for regression defined as \begin{equation} L_{sq}(y,\hat{y}) \end{equation}  where the resulting error value is given by \begin{equation} (y-\hat{y})^{2} \end{equation} This is often the loss function of choice used in estimators such as linear regression and in many areas of machine learning \citep {Davidson-Pilon:2015:BMH:2851115}. One disadvantage of using the squared loss function is that it is sensitive to outliers, since the loss increases quadratically as the estimate moves away from the true value \citep {Davidson-Pilon:2015:BMH:2851115}. A loss function which is less sensitive to outliers is the absolute-loss function, given by: \begin{equation} L(y,\hat{y})=|y-\hat{y}|\end{equation} In this case, only the absolute value is taken of the difference between the estimated and real value. However this equation is not smooth where $(y-\hat{y})$ and thus may prove to be difficult to differentiate. 
\item Finally the probability estimation via the log loss is given by: \begin{equation} L_{log}(\hat{p})=-ln(\hat{p}) \end{equation} In this case rather than simply classifying the outputs into the different classes, we may also require the confidence level that a certain input belongs to a particular class. A variation of the log loss is the cross entropy which provides the possibility of classifying input into more than two classes. A depiction of the log loss function is given in Figure~\ref{fig:logloss}
\end{itemize}

In general loss functions must satisfy certain properties. Primarily they should not be expensive to compute \citep {Scholkopf:2001:LKS:559923} have only a small number of discontinuities in the first derivative and be convex in order to able to find a unique solution. In the case of regression problems another desirable property is resistance to outliers.

\subsection {Cost Functions}
Cost functions are generally based on loss functions which have been adapted to calculate the loss over a number of training examples. In this case it is assumed that there are $n$  samples or training examples for which an approximation for each of the errors $e$ in our model is to be calculated. Thus a cost function can be interpreted as representing a total error over all corresponding predictions for the training examples. Cost functions may also include  penalty terms, such as L1 or L2, for avoiding overfitting or underfitting. Some of the most widely used cost functions in regression are briefly explained here \citep {chai2014root}.
\subsection{MSE}
The Mean Squared Error for a dataset with $n$ training samples is given by summing the error $e$ for for all examples and calculating the squared difference from the true value $y$ and the prediction value $\hat{y}$.

\begin{equation}
MSE = {\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(y-\hat{y}})
\end{equation}

\subsection{RMSE}
RMSE has been widely used as a metric for model performance in meteorology, air quality and climate research study. The calculation is done by firstly obtaining the total square error which is the sum of the individual squared errors. Total square error is then divided by $n$. Large errors in this case have a greater influence on the total square error rather than smaller errors. While the rationale for squaring the individual error is to eliminate the sign \citep {willmott2005advantages}.
The formula is given below :-

\begin{equation}
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(y-\hat{y}})
\end{equation}

\subsection{MAE}

Calculation of MAE is simple, involving the summation of the absolute errors to the obtain the total error, then dividing by the total $n$. The formula is given below :
\begin{equation}
MAE = {\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\mid{y}-\hat{y}}\mid{}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Cross Entropy Loss}

In terms of classification cost functions,  Cross Entropy is the most frequently used.
\begin{equation}
\label{10}
L(y, \hat{y}) = -y \log(\hat{y}) - (1-y) \log(1-\hat{y})
\end{equation}

A practical example of Cross Entropy function as applied to Deep Neural Networks is now described.  Deep Neural networks are commonly good performers when used as classifiers, especially since these can be easily manipulated by changing their architecture, interconnections and activation functions according to specific requirements. However for such implementations the loss function of choice is almost always log loss, which is applied through softmax at the output layer \citep {DBLP:journals/corr/JanochaC17}. Lets assume, as an example, a dataset containing a large number of hand written digits from 0 to 9 as images and it is required to build a model  to recognize the hand written digits and categorize each input into 10 different classifications. The structure of the neural network used for this example is explained in Figure~\ref{fig:neural}. Each image of hand written digits is 28 x 28 pixels large, thus the input layer contains 784 neurons, while at the output layer we would require 10 neurons, each representing a digit from 0 to 9. The cost function that will be used in this example is the Cross Entropy function, as described in \ref{10}.

However, this formula is only suitable for one training example. Generally the weights for a deep neural network are updated after calculating the loss of a batched number of training examples. In this case the cost would need to be averaged over all training examples, and thus the function would be rearranged as follows:

\begin{equation}
L(Y, \hat{Y}) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( y^{(i)} \log(\hat{y}^{(i)}) + (1-y^{(i)}) \log(1-\hat{y}^{(i)}) \right)
\end{equation}


In neural networks, it is required to compute how much the weights $w$ for each layer $j$  affect  the loss $L$. This can derived by finding the partial derivate of the cost function with respect to the weights, as follows:

\begin{equation}
\partial L / \partial w_j
\end{equation}

However it is generally not possible to find the partial derivative as described above directly. Instead by applying the chain rule it can be found how much the weights affect the activation functions for each layer and in turn how much these activation functions ultimately affect the loss. This can be formally described as follows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_j} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}} \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial w_j}
\end{equation}

After finding the partial derivative of each function as described, the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to the weights can be substituted and finalised:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_j} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}} \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial w_j}\newline
    = \frac{\hat{y} - y}{\hat{y}(1 - \hat{y})} \hat{y} (1-\hat{y}) w_j\newline
    = (\hat{y} - y) w_j.\newline
 \end{equation}
